    "# Deploy voyage-code-02 model package from AWS Marketplace \n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding models, a crucial building block for retrieval systems, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), are neural networks that convert documents into numerical vectors. Voyage-code-02 is a cutting-edge embedding model that is trained particularly for semantic retrieval of code and code-related texts from both natural language and code queries. The model excels in code-related AI applications, including semantic code search/retrieval, code completion, and various functions of general code assistants. On 11 code retrieval tasks, voyage-code-02 has a significant 16.94% improvement over any alternatives, including OpenAI and Cohere. Voyage-code-02 also has consistent enhancements, averaging 4.93%, across general-purpose corpora.\n",
